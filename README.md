# GameOfLife

Hello!

Welcome to Conway's Game of Life, in Python!

The controls are simple:
Click anywhere to manually birth the cells of your choosing. Either click or drag to place your "eggs".
When you are ready, hit "space" to begin the passage of time. Watch life take it's course!

The rules are... a little less simple:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Time to create life!
